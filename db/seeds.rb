One common question is:\n\nWhat is functional programming?\n\nProgrammers who will be interviewing you like to hear the word paradigm used with respect to this question. A paradigm is the principles and rules to how to do something. Functional programming is a programming paradigm, with rules and principles describing the creation of functions.\n\nOne major functional programming rule is that functions should be 'pure.' This means that a function does not change the value of the arguments passed into it and that if the same arguments are passed into it, the same result will always be returned.\n\nFor example:\n\nfunction notPure1(cost,quantity) {\n   cost = 1; // this is not pure because an argument being passed into this function is having it's value assigned or changed\n   return cost * quantity;\n\n}\n\nfunction notPure2(cost,quantity) {\n  return cost*quantity*Math.random(); // not pure because this will return a different answer every time, even if the value of the arguments passed in are the same\n\n}\n\nAnother functional programming principle is that functions should not cause side effects. This means that a function should not mess with or change variables that are not specifically declared within it, i.e. local variables.\n\nExample:\n\nglobalVar = 1;\n\nfunction willCauseSideEffect() {\n\n  var a = 1;\n  var b = 2;\n  globalVar = 3; // this is a side effect because you are changing the value of a non-local variable, which is not allowed in functional programming\n  return a*b;\n}", challenge_no:nil, level:nil, test_assertions:nil, test_url:nil, video_explanation_url:nil, is_challenge:true)

This is why you can declare and define a function at the end of your JavaScript code, but you can still call it at the beginning of your code, before the point where it's declared and defined.\n\nFunctions declared using the following format: var someName = function() {}, are known as function expressions or function literals or a variable assigned to an anonymous function.
